# We have lots of issues related to using pycurl locally on (M1?) macs.
# We have specific installation instructions for pycurl here:
#   https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-manuals/wiki/Getting-started#pycurl
# However this sometimes still doesn't seem to be enough for pycurl when running the celery workers.
# Importing pycurl here - notably before the import at kombu.asynchronous.http.curl:15 - seems to mitigate the error
# I've seen a lot lately:
#   ImportError: pycurl: libcurl link-time version (7.76.1) is older than compile-time version (7.85.0)
# See https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-api/pull/3687 for a little more of the investigation/notes
