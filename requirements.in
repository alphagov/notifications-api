# We originally pinned this due to eventlet v0.33 compatibility issues. That was supposedly fixed in version v21.0.0 and we merged v21.2.0 for a while. Until we ran a load test again, and identified that the bumped version of gunicorn led to a 33%+ drop-off in performance/requests per second that the API was able to handle. If a version greater than 21.2.0 is released, and it either gives us something we need or we think it addresses said performance issues, make sure to run a load test in staging before releasing to production.
