<h2>
    How to review email branding requests added to the branding pool
</h2>
<p>
    Administrators will need to review all requests to make sure they can remain in the branding pool. Check:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>image quality</li>
    <li>if it can be used by more than one service</li>
    <li>branding name</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Image quality</h3>

<p>Check the image has a transparent background and is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>landscape</li>
    <li>not distorted or stretched</li>
    <li>not low resolution</li>
</ul>

<h4>Text in a logo</h4>
<p>
    Some logos may contain text. If the logo contains the name of the service or organisation, it must be clear to read. Ideally, text size ideally should not be less than 14px.
</p>
<p>
    Use your judgement for text that does not convey important information about the brand identity.
</p>

<h4>Duplicate logo</h4>
<p>
    Logos that exist already should be removed from the branding pool.
</p>

<h3>
    2. Used by more than one service
</h3>
<p>
    Logos in the pool can be used by more than one service unless a user lets us know it can’t.
</p>

<h3>
    3. Branding name
</h3>

<p>
    Users provide alt text when they upload a logo. We use this alt text to help create a name for the brand. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alt text provided: Greenwich Council</li>
    <li>Brand name we give: Greenwich Council</li>
</ul>

<h4>Renaming branding</h4>
<p>
    We can rename the branding if there are many alternate versions. Users may find it hard to choose between them if the names are not descriptive enough. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Greenwich Council</li>
    <li>Greenwich Council (alternate 1)</li>
    <li>Greenwich Council (alternate 2)</li>
    <li>Greenwich Council (alternate 3)</li>
</ul>
